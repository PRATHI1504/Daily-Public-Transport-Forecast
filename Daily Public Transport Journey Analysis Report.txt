Public Transport Ridership Analysis & Forecasting Report

Overview

This documentation summarizes the multi-year analysis of daily public transport passenger journeys and presents a 7-day forecast for multiple service types. The study focuses on understanding ridership patterns, identifying operational challenges, and generating data-driven predictions using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA).

Dataset Summary

The dataset contains daily ridership counts for the following service categories:

Local Route

Rapid Route

Peak Service

Light Rail

School Service

Each entry includes:
Date, Route Type, Daily Passenger Count, and Operational Notes (e.g., holiday effects).

Time span: Multiple years of continuous daily observations, allowing strong seasonal and trend-based modeling.

Weekly Cycles (Descriptive Behaviors Only — No Insights Here)

Ridership typically rises on weekdays, driven by office commuters and students.

Lower values appear on weekends, reflecting reduced travel needs.

School Services follow academic calendars, showing spikes during term time and falling sharply during vacations.

Weekly seasonality is consistent across Local and Rapid routes but more irregular for Peak and School services.

Observed Long-Term Trends

Local and Rapid Routes show a gradual upward trend, indicating increasing urban mobility demand.

Light Rail maintains a stable long-term pattern but occasionally fluctuates due to infrastructure upgrades and city events.

Peak Service remains comparatively steady, serving mostly fixed-time commuters.

School Service exhibits a repetitive term-based seasonal structure.

High Volatility in Small Services

Small-volume categories such as Peak Service and School Routes experience sharp day-to-day fluctuations.
Factors contributing to volatility:

Exam weeks

Unexpected holidays

Event-based traffic changes

Weather-driven travel behavior shifts

These fluctuations require smoothing techniques before forecasting.

Distribution Characteristics

Ridership values display a right-skewed distribution, with most days having moderate demand but a few extreme high-volume days.
This behavior is common in public transport systems, especially during:

Festivals

Public gatherings

Long weekends

Tourist seasons

Impact of Special Events

Special events cause sudden spikes or dips in ridership. Examples include:

City festivals

Government holidays

Sporting events

Public strikes

Heavy rainfall or weather alerts

These irregularities create outliers in the time series and require careful preprocessing.

Key Insights (5 Highest-Value Insights Only)

These insights are independent from the Weekly Cycles section.

Insight: Weekday Patterns Drive Core Demand

Consistently higher weekday ridership shows that essential commuting remains the backbone of the transport system.

Insight: Long-Term Growth in Local & Rapid Routes

These two segments form the most stable and scalable categories, helping planners prioritize fleet expansion.

Insight: High Variability in School & Peak Routes

Erratic patterns require flexible scheduling strategies and dynamic resource allocation.

Insight: Event-Driven Outliers Affect Forecast Accuracy

Outliers must be treated carefully to avoid distorted predictions and unstable models.

Insight: Right-Skewed Demand Indicates Occasional Overload Days

Transport operators must plan contingency capacity for rare high-demand days.

Forecasting Approach (SARIMA)

The SARIMA model is used because the dataset shows clear seasonality, trend, and irregular variations.
Forecast is generated independently for:

Local Route

Rapid Route

Light Rail

Peak Service

School Route

Model steps included:

Resampling data to daily series

Detecting seasonality using ACF/PACF

Parameter tuning with grid search

Train-test split for accuracy measurement

7-day forward prediction

SARIMA captures weekly seasonality effectively, enabling more reliable forecasts.

7-Day Ridership Forecast (Summary)

The model generates ridership estimates for each service category.
The forecast helps operational teams:

Allocate buses/trains

Plan crew schedules

Manage crowding

Reduce operational costs
