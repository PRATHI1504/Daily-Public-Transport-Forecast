Introduction

Understanding fluctuations in public transport usage is essential for optimizing fleet deployment and improving commuter experience. Daily ridership varies due to weekday patterns, weekend slowdowns, school schedules, and special events. This report examines historical passenger trends across multiple service types and generates a short-term 7-day forecast using the SARIMA model.

Objectives

Examine past ridership behaviour and seasonal trends

Extract operational insights from the data

Produce a 7-day demand forecast for each service line

Assess the model using standard performance metrics

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes daily passenger counts for multiple transport services. Each column represents a different service category.

Column	Description
Date	Daily calendar date
Local Route	Ridership on neighbourhood bus routes
Light Rail	Passenger counts on light rail systems
Peak Service	Transport usage during peak-hour operations
Rapid Route	High-speed bus corridor ridership
School	Student-oriented service passenger counts
Key Insights

Local Route and Rapid Route consistently show strong weekday activity.

Light Rail demonstrates a steady but gradual upward trend.

Small-volume services display high volatility, making them harder to predict.

Sudden spikes often align with public holidays or city-wide events.

Growth in uncategorized counts hints at possible data classification drift.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed missing or invalid values, ensuring no negative ridership entries

Converted the date column to a datetime index

Resampled to daily frequency to maintain continuity

Used summary statistics and plots to inspect outliers and irregular patterns

Exploratory Data Analysis
Trend Patterns

Local Route and Rapid Route present a gradual upward trajectory

Peak Service demand remains mostly unchanged over years

Seasonal Behaviour

Strong weekday demand with predictable dips on weekends

School services sharply increase during academic terms

Variability & Outliers

Peak Service and School ridership are the most unstable day-to-day

Holidays or city events lead to noticeable temporary ridership spikes

Distribution Characteristics

High-volume routes exhibit right-skewed distributions

Low-volume services frequently report zero or near-zero ridership

Forecasting Methodology
Model

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Why SARIMA?

Effectively handles seasonal cycles and non-stationary behavior

Suitable for daily transport demand with weekly recurrence

Offers interpretable predictions and confidence intervals

Workflow

Preprocessing and stationarity checks

ADF test for differencing needs

Route-wise SARIMA model fitting

Generation of 7-day forecasts

Negative forecast outputs clipped to zero

Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE

Operational Insights & Recommendations

Increase fleet availability on weekdays and during school term months

Scale down deployments on weekends and non-working holidays

Reassign under-utilized buses to busier corridors

Investigate anomalies within “Other” categories to improve data quality

Technical Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels (SARIMAX)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, SMAPE

Future Enhancements

Explore automated hyperparameter tuning for SARIMA

Benchmark against models like Prophet, XGBoost, or LSTM

Incorporate holiday calendars for improved accuracy

Build a real-time forecasting dashboard with Flask or Streamlit

Use clustering techniques to group routes with similar demand patterns

Conclusion

The SARIMA-driven analysis offers actionable forecasting for daily public transport operations. High-volume services yield reliable predictions, while smaller categories require careful handling due to volatility. These insights support strategic fleet planning, demand management, and service optimization across the transport network.
